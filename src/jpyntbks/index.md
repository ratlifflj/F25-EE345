## Supplementary Jupyter Notebooks  

Throughout the course we will post Jupyter Notebooks that are meant to supplement the lecture and give you
an opportunity to explore the more theoretical concepts through real world
applications. You are encouraged but not required to explore these notebooks. They may also help with ideas for the course project.
