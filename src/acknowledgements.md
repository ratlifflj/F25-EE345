This website is generated by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The text is set in the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) font family by Rasmus Andersson. Prof. Ratliff borrowed the theme and style from the CSE 373 course. Specifically, this quarter's website was built on the development for CSE373 20su by Brian Chan, Howard Xiao, and Aaron Johnston. The theme for the course website draws inspiration from [Just the Class][], with thanks to its author Kevin Lin. We also thank students Austin Jenchi and Jeremy Zhang who contributed improvements to our fork.
