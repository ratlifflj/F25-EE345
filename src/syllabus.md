## Goals

This focus of this course is the use of linearity in systems theory. It provides foundational tools for modeling and control and serves as a prerequisite for more advanced courses in control theory, robotics, and optimization. The class will be mathematically rigorous, and builds upon concepts familiar from linear algebra (510), ordinary differential equations, and feedback control. In addition to analytical results, we will see computational tools and illustrate abstract concepts whenever possible using numerical examples.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
  - construct and simulate linear control system models for physical phenomena;
  - approximate nonlinear control system models using linear control systems;
  - assess stability, controllability, and observability of linear control systems;
  - design and implement a stabilizing controller + observer for linear systems.

**This course syllabus is a living document.** 
  - All course materials will be posted on the course website. 
  - We will only use canvas for announcements, submitting homework and self-grades. 
  - Gradescope will be used for submitting the exam. 

Specific topics we will cover include:


**Prerequisite**: EE/AA 510. **This is a hard requirement**. We will build off of
where 510 left off, and it iwll be difficult to keep up and solve homework
problems (a
big part of the grade) if you have not mastered that material.

## Course Components

### Grade Breakdown

Your percentage grade in this course will be weighted using these categories:

| Category                                 | Weight |
|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| Homework                                | 30% |
| Take Home Exam                          | 30% |
| Final Project                           | 30% |                              
| **Total**                               | **100%** |

### Project


### Homework

There will be four individual written exercises. They focus on mechanical, theory, and basic application problems to reinforce content from lecture, and are explicitly designed to provide practice for the exams. Exercises are distributed on the course website in PDF form and due on Gradescope. Exercises are to be completed individually, although you may discuss concepts and problems at a high-level as outlined in our Collaboration policy.

### Exam



### Collaboration
Learning these ideas is challenging. We encourage you to discuss course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally; we want a class that is open, welcoming, and collaborative, where we can help each other build the highest possible understanding of the course material. However, to encourage everyone to learn the material, we impose restrictions on the information you may share with your classmates (see below).

Whenever you receive help from a third-party source, **please cite any help that you receive** as a method comment in code or as a footnote in writeups. There is no penalty for working with too many classmates. When in doubt, you should always err on the side of giving credit.

Ultimately, **the goal of enrolling in this course is for _you_ to learn this material**, so that you will be prepared for exams, for research, for job interviews, etc.  Engaging in academic misconduct does not help you towards that goal. If you are in doubt about what might constitute cheating, send the course staff an email describing the situation and we will be happy to clarify it for you.


## Course Tools

This quarter, we will use a number of different tools in EE/AA 547. Reach out to the course staff if you have questions about using any of them.

### Zoom
We will have a single [Zoom link](
 https://washington.zoom.us/j/93892460942) for the course. This will be used for remote
lecture sessions as well as for office hours. 

### Canvas
Like many other EE/AA courses, we are mainly using [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1513853) as a gradebook and a place to find Zoom/Panapto recordings. Please refer to the course website for most course information, including assignment specs and due dates. Recordings will be linked from the course website to Canvas or Google Drive where they are hosted.

### Discord
 [Discord](https://discord.gg/kEQyUWwKM7) will be used as a discussion board. More details below. It is optional however I will be active on there answering questions on homework and lecture content. 

### Gradescope
We will only use [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/337452) for uploading the exam. All other assignments will
be uploaded to canvas. 

## Getting Help from Staff & Peers

### Discussion Board
 [Discord](https://discord.gg/kEQyUWwKM7) both serve as online discussion forums. For most questions about the course or materials, they are the right place to ask: the course staff read them regularly, so you will get a quick answer.  However, if you need to send the course staff a private message, we recommend canvas or direct email instead of Discord's private messages since these are easily missed.

To meet with us, the best way is to visit our virtual Office Hours. Many of us are available at other times by appointment. In Office Hours, you can ask questions about the material, receive guidance on assignments, and work with peers and course staff in a small group setting.

### Office Hours
Office Hours are scheduled times where you can meet with members of the course staff to discuss course concepts, get assistance with specific parts of the assignments, or discuss computer science and/or life outside of it.



## Course Climate
### Extenuating Circumstances: "Don't Suffer in Silence"
We recognize that our students come from varied backgrounds and can have widely-varying circumstances. We also acknowledge that the incredibly unusual circumstances of this particular quarter may bring unique challenges. If you have any unforeseen circumstances that arise during the course, please do not hesitate to contact the course staff or the instructor to discuss your situation. **The sooner we are made aware, the more easily we can provide accommodations.**

Typically, extenuating circumstances include work-school balance, familial responsibilities, health concerns, or anything else beyond your control that may negatively impact your performance in the class. Additionally, while some amount of "productive struggle" is healthy for learning, you should ask the course staff for help if you have been stuck on an issue for a very long time.

Life happens! While our focus is providing an excellent educational environment, our course does not exist in a vacuum. Our ultimate goal as a course staff is to provide you with the ability to be successful, and we encourage you to work with us to make that happen.

### Disabilities
Your experience in this class should not be affected by any disabilities that you may have. The [Disability Resources for Students](http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/) (DRS) office can help you establish accommodations with the course staff.

??? "DRS Instructions for Students</summary>"
    If you have already established accommodations with DRS, please communicate your approved accommodations to the lecturers at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course.

    If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions.

    Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your lecturer(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.

### Religious Accommodations
Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UWâ€™s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).

### Inclusion
Our code and our projects are made better by considering a variety of viewpoints. Your course staff is committed to the values outlined in the [University's inclusiveness statement](https://hr.uw.edu/diversity/hiring/dei-commitment-statement/), and you are expected to uphold a supportive and inclusive learning environment.

If, at any point, you are made to feel uncomfortable, disrespected, or excluded by a staff member or fellow student, please report the incident so that we may address the issue and maintain a supportive and inclusive learning environment. Should you feel uncomfortable bringing up an issue with a staff member directly, you may consider contacting the [Office of the Ombud](https://www.washington.edu/ombud/).
