We're excited to be working with you this quarter, even as we are still slugging through the pandemic! This course will be taught in a 'flipped' style organized into modules. This means you will watch pre-recorded videos for each module that are between 15-35mins long. The schedule will be posted to this website. During the in-class sessions will we have a very brief high level review of concepts and then solve problems related to those concepts. There will also be time for you to ask questions. Some of these sessions will be over zoom (you are always welcome to join via zoom if you, say, need to quarantine) and some will be in person. 

The class will have weekly homework starting in week 2. These homeworks will be
'self-graded'. The purpose of self-grading is to 
    1. Incentivize you to review your homework solutions. I have found this to
       be instrumental in making sure students' understanding of topic is
solidified, and retention is improved. 
    2. Give you the opportunity to earn full-credit on the homework.
We will select 1-2 homework problems per assignment to hand grade. More detail
on self-grading can be found on the homework link. 

All in-class sessions will be recorded as well. Office hours will be over zoom.
We will also have a discord that we will use for discussion related to lectures
and homework. 

To prepare for the quarter, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the [Syllabus](/syllabus.md) to learn about how the course will run online. You can also check out the [Staff Page](/staff/index.md) to meet the instructional team, or the [Calendar](/index.md#calendar) to get a preview of the topics we'll cover. Other content such as projects and exercises will be published here as they are released during the quarter.

We're looking forward to meeting you! Please reach out to the staff if you have any questions or concerns about the quarter.
