We're excited to be working with you this quarter. 

To prepare for the quarter, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the [Syllabus](/syllabus.md) to learn about how the course will run online. You can also check out the [Staff Page](/staff/index.md) to meet the instructional team, or the [Calendar](/index.md#calendar) to get a preview of the topics we'll cover. Other content such as projects and exercises will be published here as they are released during the quarter.

The class will have weekly homework starting in week 2. These homeworks will be
'self-graded'. The purpose of self-grading is to 
    1. Incentivize you to review your homework solutions. I have found this to
       be instrumental in making sure students' understanding of topic is
solidified, and retention is improved. 
    2. Give you the opportunity to earn full-credit on the homework.
We will select 1-2 homework problems per assignment to hand grade. More detail
on self-grading can be found on the homework link. 

All in-class sessions will be recorded, and we will also create an online discussion board (mechanism TBD) that we will use for discussion related to lectures
and homework. 

We're looking forward to meeting you! Please reach out to the staff if you have any questions or concerns about the quarter.
